This repository contains a detailed approach to predicting the net hourly electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant. The dataset used, coursework other.csv, contains data from 2006-2011, with features including Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Relative Humidity, and Exhaust Vacuum. We employed two machine learning algorithms, a deep learning model and a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, for the prediction task. A dummy model from scikit-learn was used as the baseline for comparison. The code and accompanying report detail the process of selecting and tuning these algorithms, choosing a performance metric, and testing the models' robustness and generalization ability.
