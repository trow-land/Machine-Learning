#Predictive Modeling for Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant

This repository contains a detailed approach to predicting the net hourly electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant. The dataset used, coursework other.csv, contains data from 2006-2011, with features including Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Relative Humidity, and Exhaust Vacuum. We employed two machine learning algorithms, a deep learning model and a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, for the prediction task. A dummy model from scikit-learn was used as the baseline for comparison. The code and accompanying report detail the process of selecting and tuning these algorithms, using R2 and RMSE for comparison, and testing the models' robustness and generalisation ability.
