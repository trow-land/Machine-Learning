# TensorFlow Developer Certification

Here are the first 3 of the NLP related assessments for the Tensorflow Developer Certification course. The fourth assessment, although successfully completed was not retained and is therefore missing. 


## Techniques Covered



### Text Preprocessing
Understanding how to clean and prepare text data. Techniques can include lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenisation, and so forth.

### Word Embeddings
Understanding how to represent text data numerically using techniques like one-hot encoding, Word2Vec, or using pre-trained embeddings.

### Sequence Padding
Knowing how to make the text sequences of uniform length using padding techniques.

### RNNs and LSTMs
Introduction to using Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequence data like text.

### Text Classification
Learning how to classify text into predefined categories.

### Sentiment Analysis
A specific type of text classification that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text.

### Sequence Models
Learning how to use sequence-to-sequence models for tasks like machine translation.
