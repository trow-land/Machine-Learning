# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects I've developed as part of my ongoing skill-building and exploration of applied ML techniques. The work spans general supervised learning, NLP, reinforcement learning, and generative AI, with each project structured in its own directory. While some larger or production-focused projects are kept in separate repositories, this repo showcases a broad survey of methods, datasets, and learning objectives.

## Repository Structure

- `Archived_Projects/` – Older exploratory work, including house price regression and water quality prediction
- `Artemia_count_dashboard/` – A regression-based dashboard for monitoring Artemia populations
- `Generative-AI/` – LLM-based projects for summarisation and emotion-aware dialogue
- `NLP/` – NLP classification and summarisation projects using classical and transformer-based models
- `Predictive Modeling for Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant/` – Comparative ML modelling of energy output
- `Reinforcement_learning/` – Q-learning and DQN implementations, including multi-agent simulations
