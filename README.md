# Machine Learning Projects

## About
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository is dedicated to my ongoing journey in the field of machine learning. It serves as a compilation of various projects that I have completed, ranging from smaller, single-notebook projects to more complex endeavors. While larger projects will have their own dedicated repositories, you'll find simpler projects right here, each in its own directory for easy navigation. This is a work in progress, I have more experience with computer vision but I have completed the TensorFlow Developer Certification and there are more machine learning projects in the pipeline!

## Repository Structure
Each project resides within its own directory and typically includes:
- A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file containing the Python code.
- A README.md file detailing the purpose of the project, the approach taken, and any significant findings or conclusions.
- Any necessary data files and additional resources (e.g., images or supplementary text files).

## Projects
Here are the current projects available in this repository:
