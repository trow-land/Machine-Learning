## Introduction

Briefly introduce the project here. What is it about? What problem does it solve?

### Objectives

- Refresh my skills by comparing multiple regression algorithms on the Housing.csv dataset
- Train models on local GPU 
- Inspect, clean and process dataset with pandas and scikit-learn

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow 2.10.0
- see requirements.txt

## Installation

Installation can be conducted with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

This project will be conducted in the jupyter notebook [housePricesRegression.ipynb](code/housePricesRegression.ipynb) for ease of visualisation and comparison.



## Data

The dataset used was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset). The dataset consists of multiple features targeting a predicted house price.
